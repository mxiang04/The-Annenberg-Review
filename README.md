# How to use the website

Below is a link to our video for a more visual demonstration!

First and foremost, a user will need to register for the website if they are to use it. When the website is first opened, the new user is advised to click the register button in the top corner of the page. This will take the user to the register page, where the user will be prompted to enter a username, password, and then repeat their password to confirm their account credentials. The user is then advised to press the register button to confirm that the account is registered. If no username or password is given, or the username or password is already taken, then the user will see an error on the screen. For this reason, enter the username "CS50" and the password "Malan" for the register page, as it has not already been stored in the database of created users. Once this user is registered, the user will be sent to the main menu page.

The menu page contains all three breakfast, lunch, and dinner menus annenberg has to offer. In this page, there are options to explore other parts of the website at the top of the page, but if we want to see the main menus, we can click the "which menu" space, and a options of breakfast, lunch and dinner will display. After choosing one, the user should click "select menu" and then a list of all the different dishes and their categories will appear on the screen below. An example of this could be the dish "pancakes" with the category "breakfast entrees". This is the basic structure of all three menus.

To create a review, the user should hit the "upload" space on the bar at the top of the page. This will then take the user to a page where the user can create a review that will be posted on the main feed of annenberg review on the website. To create a review, the user should hit arrow next to the "rating" box and will then see a list from 1 to 5 appear. They should then pick one of the corresponding integer values, where numbers a positive relationship with increasing satisfaction of the experience at annenberg. Underneath this, the user then has the option to write a written comment that will couple with the rating to form a review. The user should fill out both parts of the review, or an error will occur on the screen. Once the user has finished with their review, they should press the "upload" button under the text entry space. This will then upload the review to the "your profile" page and take the user there, where the words "submitted" will flash at the top of the screen.

In the "your profile" page, the user will be able to see all aspects of any review they created in the past. The user can see what they rated annenberg on that day, what their text comments were, as well as the exact time and date when they uploaded the review. The user cannot do much on this page other than deleting any of their own reviews that they no longer wish to appear in the main annenberg feed. To delete a review, the user should press the blue "delete" button on the righthand side of the page, horizontally even with whatever review is in question.

To leave this page, the user should look to the top yellow bar, where they can choose to go to any other portions of the website, including feed.

The "feed" page allows the user to see all of the reviews that different annenberg attendants gave the dininghall in the past. This page will display a list of every review created, including the user's own reviews. This page will appear in an extremely similar structure to the "your profile" page, except all user's usernames will be displayed and reviews cannot be deleted from this page. "Feed", like all of the other pages outside of "login" and "register", allows the user to reach different parts of the website by clicking the words on the yellow bar on the top of the page.

If the user wishes to logout of their account, they can hit the "logout" text on the yellow bar atop the page. By doing this, they will be brought to the "login" page, where they can enter their username and password to regain access to the main homepages of the website.

If the "Annenberg Reviews" logo in the top left corner of the page is pressed, it will bring the user to the menu page unless the user has no logged in or registered. If the user has not done either, clicking this icon will bring the user to the login page.
